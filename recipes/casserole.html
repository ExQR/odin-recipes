            <li>4 ounces sugar snap peas, strings removed, halved</li>
            <li>6 asparagus spears, ends trimmed, cut into 1-inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups milk</li>
            <li>1 cup grape tomatoes, halved</li>
            <li>1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
            <li>⅓ cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>¼ cup panko bread crumbs</li>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F. Spray a 9x13-inch baking dish with cooking spray.</li>
            <li>Cook pasta according to package directions. Drain and transfer to a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook bell pepper, squash, and garlic, stirring occasionally, until pepper is crisp-tender, 7 to 10 minutes. Add snap peas and asparagus and cook, stirring, until asparagus is crisp-tender, 2 minutes more.</li>
